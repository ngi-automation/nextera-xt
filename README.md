## Description ##
This README describes how to set up NGI Stockholms Nextera XT method for the Agilent NGS Workstation. This protocol can be used to prepare up to 96 samples with Illumina's Nextera XT kit.

## Requirements ##
- Agilent NGS Workstation :warning: <i><b>Option B only</i></b>
- Consumables
   - Eppendorf twin.tec 96 PCR plate (Eppendorf, cat# 0030 128.672 (int); 951020460 (US))
   - Nunc deepwell 1.3 mL plate (Thermo Scientific, cat# 260251)
   - ABgene 2.2 mL storage plate Mk.II (Thermo Scientific, cat# AB-0933)
- Deepwell plate adaptor on position 6 (Agilent Technologies, cat# G5498B#012) and supporting device file
- Labware definitions*
- Liquid classes definition*

\* provided in `all_labware_liquids.vzp`

## Installation ##
### Download files ###


##### Using Git #####
Clone into `https://github.com/ngi-automation/nextera-xt.git` from the `Protocol Files` directory:

```bash
cd "C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files"
git clone https://github.com/ngi-automation/nextera-xt.git
```

Alternatively, download the compressed folder from:
[`https://github.com/ngi-automation/nextera-xt/archive/master.zip`][zip]
and extract to `C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files`. Rename the resulting `nextera-xt-master` folder to `nextera-xt`. The path to the folder containing the extracted files should then be `C:\VWorks Workspace\Protocol Files\nextera-xt`.

### Configure ###
#### Labware and and liquid class definitions ####
Use the import feature in VWorks from `File â€º Import`in the toolbar and select the `all_labware_liquids.vzp` file included. See the [VWorks Knowledge Base][import] for more information.

#### Device files ####
Device files and profiles are system specific and will not be provided. The "standard" Bravo configuration is used in the Nextera XT protocols:

##### Standard configuration #####
Position | Type | Part#
-------: | ---- | -----
1&ndash;3, 8  | Deck Platepad | `G5498b#004`
4, 6     | Peltier Thermal Station (Inheco) | `G5498b#021`
5        | Orbital Shaking Station | `G5498b#033`
7        | Magnetic Bead Accessory | `G5498b#008`
9        | Thermal Station (ThermoCube) | `G5498b#036`/`7`/`8`

For reference see Agilent's [accessories catalog][catalog] for the Bravo.

:warning:  Each `.pro` file must have the correct device file set.

See the [VWorks Knowledge Base][device-file] for more information on how to select the device file.
